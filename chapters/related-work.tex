\chapter{Related Work}\label{chap:RelatedWork}

Developers are increasingly using IDEs to write code, as they provide features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and code navigation, thanks also to the Language Server Protocol (LSP) \cite{Rodriguez-Echeverria18a}.
According to Tomasetti~\cite{tomassetti_complete_2017}, an external Domain-Specific Language in contrast to an internal one has tool support. So, in order to build this support language workbenches come to the rescue.
To develop this kind of tool support, there are various language workbenches available that simplify the creation of abstract syntax, parsers, editors, and generators~\cite{Fowler05}.

Xtext is by now the only language workbench supporting the LSP.~\cite{Bunder19a}



\subsection{JustAdd}\label{subsec:background:justadd}

\textit{JustAdd}~\cite{Ekman07b} is a modular compiler construction system developed at the Computer Science department of the Lund University.
It doesnâ€™t offer built-in support for concrete syntax definition or parser generation, however it can be easily integrated with third-party parser generators; language development in JastAdd, instead, is focused on modeling the AST as an object-oriented class hierarchy. Semantic phases are defined as methods in the AST classes, and the compiler is generated by the JastAdd compiler generator.
